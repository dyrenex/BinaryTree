# BinaryTree
### A Challenge I Had Set To Myself
I made a binary tree program in under 30 minutes

### About
I had remembered about Binary Tree's from my time at high school and wondered
whether or not I could make a binary tree in a short amount of time.

I was able to comeplete and fully comment my code in under 30 minutes. I am happy with the result and my ability and knownledge of C++ I have gained throughout the years.

#### Why?
I wanted to make something that I had done in the past, to see if I could do it in a short amount of time. This particular program, many years ago, had stumped me near the end of my "advance C++ course" in high school. I wanted to see if I could remember it and also great a better version that what I had done in the past.

### Time
*Start:* **8:42**

*Stop:*  **9:09**

*Total Time:* _**27 Minutes**_

### Result
I was able to complete the program, while also avoiding any serious program breaking bugs. I am happy with the simple but time consuming program that I had made; when I had first learned and made my first binary tree, this program had took about a week to complete, and had always crashed and broke with the simplest of inputs.
